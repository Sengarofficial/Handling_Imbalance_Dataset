## Handling_Imbalance_Dataset:

Any dataset with an unequal class distribution is technically imbalanced.However, a dataset is said to be imbalanced when there is a significant, or in some cases extreme, disproportion among the number of examples of each class of the problem.

A slight imbalance is often not a concern, and the problem can often be treated like a normal problem can often be treated like a normal classification predictive modeling problem. A severe imbalance of the classes can be challenging to model and may require the use of specialized techniques.

Imbalanced dataset is not heavly impacted by ensemble technique or where decision tree works.
